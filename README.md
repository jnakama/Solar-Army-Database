# Solar-Army-Database

Online app for storing testing results from CV Solar Army club.

The Solar Army is an Caltech Outreach Program testing for efficient hydrolysis catalysts to create hydrogen gas. 
Using Solar Energy Activity Lab (SEAL) program, high school students spot plates with various transition metal solutions,
place the plates in a kiln, and run a current through an attached wire. 

Plates with successful transition metal catalysts will release electrons through hydrolysis, which the SEAL program will capture.

This app is for high school students to record and sort their data.
